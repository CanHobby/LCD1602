We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of
https://github.com/xpertsavenue/WiringOP-Zero from which the 
wiringPi.c and wiringPi.h progras have been lifted. The github offeres
many more examples of using GPIO, SPI and I2C etc on the Orange Pi.
It is the only wiringOP version that is close to completely functional.
The others are sadly lacking in a complete map of the GPIO bus.
